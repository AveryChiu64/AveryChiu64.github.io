							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a keen interest in firmware and embedded systems.
						I recently joined WATonomous, a self-driving car team that participates in the SAE Autodrive Challenge, as the Telemetry/CAN Interface
						Manager. There I work mainly on the development of the ROS interface. I am also a firmware project lead for the
						Midnight Sun Solar Car Team, and mainly work on bringing up the telemetry system and leading a new project called CAN Explorer.
						In this website, I have documented my work and projects I have created
						throughout my time in university.

								<h3>Ford Motor Company</h3>
								<p> I am currently a Firmware Development co-op at Ford. My role is to work on developing the bootloader and kernel
									for the telematics control unit (TCU) and also Sync, Ford's infotainment system. These systems play an important
									role in Ford vehicles.

								<h3>Geotab</h3>
								<p> I interned at Geotab as an Automotive R&D Intern. Here I worked on many different projects.
									I desgined the schematic, PCB layout, BOM, and Gerber files using Altium Designer for a
									PCB used to test for proper connections to a keyfob. I also spent a lot of time
									performing data analysis with Google BigQuery and preparing visualizations based off of
									data from vehicles.

								<h3>Cigbot</h3>
								<p>My friends and I won an award at MakeUofT21 for building Cigbot. We created a robot that would safely pick up
									and dispose of cigarette butts on the ground. We used a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Pi Camera to detect cigarette butts,
									drive towards them, and pick them up. </p>

								<h3>STM32F103C8T6 Drivers</h3>
								<p>I wrote GPIO,I2C,SPI, and USART for an STM32F103C8T6. These drivers were mainly created for me to familiarize myself
									with navigating datasheets and finding the right information from the right places (eg memory map, vector tables).</p>

								<h3>Hand Sanitizing Watch</h3>
								<p>I attended the Hack the 6ix hackathon which was hosted online. My friends and I decided to have fun with this project
									and I had the opportunity to play with an ESP32 which I had just purchased. For the project, I wrote code to allow
									the ESP32 to interface with the MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyroscope with SPI and to control a servo motor according
									to the values of the accelerometer.

								<h3>Bike Telematics Device</h3>
								<p>We named this bike telematics device <b>Cyclus</b>. This was created for the MakeUofT Hackathon were we worked closely
								with Telus and where we used their TELUS CAT M1 cellular shield as a GPS, accelerometer, and an SMS sender. The device
								has the capability to be "locked". When locked it will detect when someone tries to steal the users bike and will help
								provide constant GPS tracking to locate the bike. It will also warn the user with an SMS message.</p>

								<h3>FIRST Robotics Competition and Robot in 3 Days</h3>
								<p> Above is a video of my robotics team (7721) competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
									I participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition in highschool which was a competition to create a robot
									that could perform certain tasks, such as launch balls, place panels, and climb. This robot is seen above. However
									I also participated in Robot in 3 Days (Ri3d) which was an extension of FIRST Robotics but a 3-day sprint instead.

								<h3>Graphing Robot</h3>
								<p> A program that interprets a function and provides the information to a LEGO EV3 robot for it to draw the graph of that function.
									This was created by 2 other mechatronics engineering students and I as a first year final project.
									It features a combination of C++ and RobotC.</p>

								<h3>Hollow Shaft Motor Drive</h3>
								<p>I participated in the 2021 National Design League Online Designathon and worked with friends of mine to
									develop housing for parts of a injection molding machine. We ended up creating plates to connect
									the motor to the axle and bearings on the machine, which connected to the staten.
									The plates can be seen in blue above and is made of 1045 steel. The motor is in red. </p>

								<h3>Self Feeding Catheter</h3>
								<p>A group of 3 friend and I were given a challenge at the McMaster Designathon to create a
									medical device that would assist doctors with inserting catheters into patients.</p>

								<h3>Automated Ferris Wheel</h3>
								<p>This ferris wheel was created for the Ontario Skills Competition. It was interesting since this was my first time
									having to program with Labview. My friend and I got a bronze medal in the Robotics
									and Control Systems category for our efforts in this one day competition.</p>
								<p>Users go through a door, where a sensor detects how many people pass. Once a certain number of people pass, the
									ferris wheel starts spinning. There is an emergency stop button that will stop the whole system with one press
									of a button.
