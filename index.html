							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a keen interest in firmware and embedded systems.
						I am also a firmware developer for the Midnight Sun Solar Car Team, and mainly work on bringing up the telemetry system and
						writing drivers for many different microcontrollers. In this website, I have documented my work and projects I have created
						throughout my time in university.

								<p> I interned at Geotab as an Automotive R&D Intern. Here I worked on different technology such as
									keyless vehicles and solar tracking devices.</p>

								<h3>STM32F103C8T6 Drivers</h3>
								<p>I wrote GPIO,I2C,SPI, and USART for an STM32F103C8T6. These drivers were mainly created for me to familiarize myself
									with navigating datasheets and finding the right information from the right places (eg memory map, vector tables).</p>

								<h3>Hand Sanitizing Watch</h3>
								<p>I attended the Hack the 6ix hackathon which was hosted online. My friends and I decided to have fun with this project
									and I had the opportunity to play with an ESP32 which I had just purchased. For the project, I wrote code to allow
									the ESP32 to interface with the MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyroscope with SPI and to control a servo motor according
									to the values of the accelerometer.

								<h3>Bike Telematics Device</h3>
								<p>We named this bike telematics device <b>Cyclus</b>. This was created for the MakeUofT Hackathon were we worked closely
								with Telus and where we used their TELUS CAT M1 cellular shield as a GPS, accelerometer, and an SMS sender. The device
								has the capability to be "locked". When locked it will detect when someone tries to steal the users bike and will help
								provide constant GPS tracking to locate the bike. It will also warn the user with an SMS message.</p>

								<h3>FIRST Robotics Competition and Robot in 3 Days</h3>
								<p> I participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition in highschool which was a competition to create a robot
									that could perform certain tasks, such as launch balls, place panels, and climb. This robot is seen above. However
									I also participated in Robot in 3 Days (Ri3d) which was an extension of FIRST Robotics but for university students.
									Instead of having 3 months to build the robot, in Ri3d we are only given 3 days to build a functioning robot.

								<h3>Self Feeding Catheter</h3>
								<p>A group of 3 friend and I were given a challenge at the McMaster Designathon to create a
									medical device that would assist doctors with inserting catheters into patients.</p>

								<h3>Graphing Robot</h3>
								<p> A program that interprets a function and provides the information to a LEGO EV3 robot for it to draw the graph of that function.
									This was created by 2 other mechatronics engineering students and I as a first year final project.
									It features a combination of C++ and RobotC.</p>

								<h3>Automated Ferris Wheel</h3>
								<p>This ferris wheel was created for the Ontario Skills Competition. It was interesting since this was my first time
									having to program with Labview. My friend and I got a bronze medal in the Robotics
									and Control Systems category for our efforts in this one day competition.</p>
								<p>Users go through a door, where a sensor detects how many people pass. Once a certain number of people pass, the
									ferris wheel starts spinning. There is an emergency stop button that will stop the whole system with one press
									of a button.
