							<h2>What is the FIRST Robotics Competition?</h2>
						</header>
						<p> The FIRST Robotics Competition is a competition for highschool students to develop a robot
                            that can perform actions such as climb, launch projectiles, and place panels. The competition usually
                            allocates students around 3 months to build the robot and then attend events to compete with other robots
                            to see which team's robot is the most efficient at their task. Below is the
                            robot that I created with other students in high school for the FIRST Robotics Competition 2019 season.

						<p>Being apart of the FIRST Robotics Competition in highschool inspired me to go to
							the University of Waterloo to study Mechatronics Engineering. I loved the idea of being able to
							design robots and it taught me a lot about mechanical design and many hands on skills. This included
							learning how to solder wires together and basic metal joining processes. Below is my highschool's robotics team's website.

                        <h2>What is Robot in 3 Days (RI3D)?</h2>
                        <p> Robot in 3 Days is an extension of FIRST Robotics but for University students. Basically instead of having
                            3 months to build a robot, we only get 3 days to make a functioning robot. This is done to provide
							inspiration to high school students. Below is a robot created in 3 days for the 2020 season of the FIRST Robotics Competition.
							This was done by fellow students and I at the University of Waterloo Sedra Student Design Centre.
