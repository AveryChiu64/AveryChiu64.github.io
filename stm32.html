							<h2>STM32F103C8</h2>
						</header>
						<p> The STM32F103C8 is a well known STM32 (commonly known as the blue pill). It has an
							ARM Cortex-M3 processor on it. Below I briefly explain how I wrote the drivers for this MCU.

							<h2>Writing the Drivers</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>The STM32 Header File</h3>
						<p> One of the first steps was figuring out which bus
							each peripheral I was going to write for was located. Then it was a matter of defining the
							address of their locations in the header file for easy access later on.
						</p>
						<img src="images/st/memory_map.png" class="midsun"/>
						<p> Above are examples of peripherals and their addresses for the STM32F103C8. I made
							sure that important periphearls such as AFIO,EXTI, and GPIO were included in the header file.
						</p>
						<h3> GPIO </h3>
						<p>  The first, and probably the most trivial, driver to write was GPIO. Below I outlined the API
							for this driver.  </p>
						<img src="images/st/gpio_api.png" class="midsun large"/>
						<p> To get the GPIO drivers to work, I simply had to enable the clock for a specific GPIO port,
							configure the settings by writing to certain GPIO registers. I defined these registers in the
							GPIO header file.
						</p>
						<img src="images/st/gpio_reg_def.png" class="midsun large"/>
						<p> I then wrote to the port configuration register in the init function.</p>
						<img src="images/st/gpio_init.png" class="midsun large"/>
						<p> To output data, in my implementation for this API I wrote to the port output data register
							to toggle the state of a GPIO pin.
						</p>

						<h3> GPIO Interrupts </h3>
						<p> For setting up GPIO interrupts, I had to set up the NVIC registers in the ARM Cortex M3 to properly
							process interrupts from the EXTI lines of the STM32. This is based off of their IRQ numbers which I defined
							in the header file.	</p>
							<img src="images/st/nvic_register.png" class="large" />
						<p>I also added to the original gpio_init function
							so that it would configure the registers for the EXTI lines and their settings, specifically which
							edge to trigger the interrupt. I also had to ensure that the EXTI line for the specific pin would be
							unmasked so the interrupt can be processed and sent to the NVIC.
						</p>

						<h3> SPI/I2C/USART </h3>
						<p> The other peripherals all follow a similar format of configuring settings
							by writing to specific registers and then setting up interrupts. Please view
							the source code and internal documentation for more details.</p>
